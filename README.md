## Chingu Voyages

Chingu is a platform that brings together developers from around the world to work on projects in teams called "Voyages". These Voyages are focused on building real-world applications and provide a supportive community to help developers improve their skills.

## [Pair Programming](https://github.com/BlueDragn/pair-programming)

Pair programming is a technique where two developers work together on the same codebase. This can be a great way to learn from each other, share ideas, and improve code quality.

## [Hackathon Projects](https://github.com/BlueDragn/projects/tree/main/Hackathon_Projects) 

Hackathons are events where developers come together to collaborate on building a project over a short period of time, usually 24-48 hours or week long. These events are great for improving your skills, networking with other developers, and building your portfolio.

## Front End Mentors

Front End Mentors is a platform that provides real-world design challenges for developers to work on. These challenges are designed to help developers improve their skills in front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
